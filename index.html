            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>In a world of constant information, we're bombarded with new ideas, articles, and tasks. Our brains can only hold so much, leading to a frustrating problem: **missing content when you need it most.**</p>
            <p>That brilliant idea you had on your commute? The essential link you saved a month ago? They vanish, buried under a pile of files or forgotten in the chaos of your daily life. This isn't just an annoyance; it's a drain on our productivity and a source of unnecessary stress.</p>
